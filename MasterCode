### (a) Time Series plot

```{r}
# Here, we convert mega-watt hours, the standard for measuring electricity consumption, into a time series format. Because the total amount of MWH is very large and impractical to conceptualize, we divide by 1,000,000 a measurement that was already represented as thousands. 

# In short, all values of mega-watt hours will be represented in billions.

mwh_ts <- ts(mwh, start = 1990, end = c(2016, 12), frequency = 12)
est.mwh <- (mwh_ts/1000000)

# Plot the time series of electricity consumption.
ts.plot(est.mwh)
```
